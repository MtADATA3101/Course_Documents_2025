Styler did not appear to make any changes to my file but I did appreciate how helpful of a tool this can be by automatiaclly making your code look the way you want it where anyone can easily understand it in a commonly accepted format. I did not lose any history that I'm aware of and I only changed the name when I did save as to the file. the sessions of live coding were very helpful with understanding this new way of coding which is a bit different from what I am used to with python. walking through the coding as a class has been very helpful with understanding what functions do and when to use them. At this time I have no suggestions on how to improve it.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

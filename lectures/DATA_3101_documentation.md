# Documentation and Curation


# Active Data Curation through Documentation

The goal with open data is to make it as FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reproducible) as possible.

Data curation often happens when the data is deposited to a repository,
but there are many benefits to including curation and management
processes when the project is active.

Examples of active data curation:

- Choosing data storage solution with version control (who / when / what
  for the edits)

- Organizing research files

  - keep organization scheme, file structure, and naming convention in a
    visible location (for example, post it in lab space)

  - make raw data read-only

  - create separate workspaces for different contributors

  - use consistent naming scheme

- Creating codebooks and data dictionaries

  - values, labels, and units for fields

  - description of handling of null values

  - ommitted variables

  - relationships between variables

- Scripting data analysis and visualization

- Sharing code

  - README file for software projects, and/or

  - Software container (hosted on Docker, for example)

## README: Two ways

[README for Research Code and
Software](https://data.research.cornell.edu/data-management/sharing/writing-readmes-for-research-code-software/)
(Cornell University)

[README for Research
Data](https://data.research.cornell.edu/data-management/sharing/readme/)
(Cornell University)

### Activity:

Review the README for Research Code and Software guidelines from Cornell
University. What suggestions do you have for the CRKN
ORCID-Data-Visualization project README?

## Data Curation Network (DCN) and the CURATE(D) Framework

CURATE(D) Framework:

- **C**heck file

- **U**nderstand or try to

- **R**equest missing information

- **A**ugment the submission

- **T**ransform the format

- **E**valuate for FAIRness

- **D**ocument throughout

This framework was adapted in the [Dataverse Curation
Guide](https://zenodo.org/records/5579820), which is used by the
librarians who support the Borealis research data repositories at
universities across Canada. Mount Allison University data deposits are
curated to Level 2.

DCN has also created [Data Curation
Primers](https://datacuration.network/outputs/data-curation-primers/)
for a variety of subjects, topics, and software. There is an [R data
primer](https://github.com/DataCurationNetwork/data-primers/blob/main/R%20Data%20Curation%20Primer/R-data-curation-primer.md).

### Activity:

Review the Data Curation Network [R Data
Primer](https://github.com/DataCurationNetwork/data-primers/blob/main/R%20Data%20Curation%20Primer/R-data-curation-primer.md)
to find ideas that can be include as suggestions for the [CRKN
ORCID-Data-Visualization](https://github.com/crkn-rcdr/ORCID-Data-Visualization)
project.

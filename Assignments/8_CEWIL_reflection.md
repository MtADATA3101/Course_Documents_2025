# Assignment 8


## Assignment 8: CEWIL Reflection

Due: November 27, 2025 at 11:59 pm

(Note that this deadline is strict, as the final grades for the course
will be discussed at ungrading meetings the following week.)

The keyword for this assignment is reflection - I want to hear what you
genuinely thought about this project. No use of generative AI is allowed
for this assignment. I expect that you spend a minimum of 15 minutes on
this assignment, but I am open to a variety of formats:

- Answer in written format and submit your response as a .md file to
  your student repository in our MtADATA3101 organization. The written
  format can be in sentence or point form. The important thing is that
  it is your own thoughts.

- [Book an
  appointment](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/LibraryAppointments@mta.ca/bookings/s/Lm8pmHeFAkCS_M_0xKAYEQ2)
  to meet before or on November 27 to talk about the project instead of
  submitting a written file.

**Section 1: CEWIL**

- What are your thoughts on working with a community partner (CRKN) to
  solve some of their data organization and visualization problems? How
  did you like working on this project as compared to traditional
  lectures, lab times, or problem sets?

- Are Udemy courses a useful supplement to in-class learning? Do
  credentials and certificates motivate you? What did you like and
  dislike about the Udemy course you selected?

**Section 2: ORCID project**

- Did you notice anything in the MtA data file outputs from the ORCID
  Data Visualization code that should be cleaned up? (Messy data,
  missing data, etc?)

- Do you think MtA should join the ORCID-CA consortium? How would that
  benefit students? How would it benefit faculty members?

- What other visualizations could we create using ORCID and/or CrossRef
  and/or DataCite?

- Do you have any ideas for improvements to the CRKN
  ORCID-Data-Visualization project that didn’t make it into the bug
  tracker?

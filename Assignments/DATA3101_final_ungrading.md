  - [substantive contribution to CRKN
    project](https://github.com/MtADATA3101/Course_Documents_2025/blob/main/lectures/DATA_3101_20251107_orcid_work_period.md#substantive-contribution-to-project-a-level)

## B-level work

- Attending 70-85% of classes live, either in-person or online
- Very clear documentation of AI usage (using comments in code files,

- Active participation in CEWIL project:
  - udemy courses complete during the work with CRKN
  - present (in-person or online) for all sessions with community

  - [average contribution to
    project](https://github.com/MtADATA3101/Course_Documents_2025/blob/main/lectures/DATA_3101_20251107_orcid_work_period.md#average-contribution-to-project-b-level)

## C-level work

  grade possible in the class. All other work would have to be at the A

## D-level work

- Not meeting the standard established for A, B, or C-level work
- Unclear disclosure of AI usage
- Submitted at least half of the assignments with an acceptable level of
  work
- Active discussion about progress on learning objectives throughout
  term

## Ungrading: F

- Not meeting the standard of D-level work
- Not engaging in CEWIL project

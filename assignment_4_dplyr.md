Styler did not appear to make any changes to my file but I did
appreciate how helpful of a tool this can be by automatiaclly making
your code look the way you want it where anyone can easily understand it
in a commonly accepted format. I did not lose any history that Iâ€™m aware
of and I only changed the name when I did save as to the file. the
sessions of live coding were very helpful with understanding this new
way of coding which is a bit different from what I am used to with
python. walking through the coding as a class has been very helpful with
understanding what functions do and when to use them. At this time I
have no suggestions on how to improve it.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a
finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that
includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed
code like this:

``` r
1 + 1
```

    [1] 2

You can add options to executable code like this

    [1] 4

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is
displayed).
